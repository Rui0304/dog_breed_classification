# Dog Breed Classifier App

  In this project, we will implement a dog breed classification algothrim using convolutional neural networks. Any user-supplied image can be input for our APP. In the image, if a dog is detected, it will estimate the breed of the dog. If a person is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
