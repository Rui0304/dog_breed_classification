# Dog Breed Classifier App

## Project Desciption
  In this project, we will implement a dog breed classification algothrim using convolutional neural networks. Any user-supplied image can be input for our APP. In the image, if a dog is detected, it will estimate the breed of the dog. If a person is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The images below display some potential outputs of our project.

## Get started

### Requirement
To train the neural network, we need an access to CUDA upported GPU.
### Notebook
The notebook dog_app.ipynb contains all the codes and explainations, also some sample outputs.

### Datasets
dogImages- It has a total of 8351 dog images of 133 categories.

lfw- It has a total of 13233 human faces.
